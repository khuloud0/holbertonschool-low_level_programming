# Recursion Project

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track.  
It contains functions that demonstrate the use of **recursion** in C.

## Files
- `0-puts_recursion.c` - prints a string, followed by a new line.
- `_putchar.c` - helper function to print characters.
- `main.h` - header file with function prototypes.
- `0-main.c` - test file for `0-puts_recursion`.

## Compilation
To compile:
```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-puts_recursion.c _putchar.c -o test
